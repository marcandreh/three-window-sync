# Sync a Three.js scene across browser windows
A library which synchronises [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) scenes across multiple browser windows.
Logic only relies on vanilla JavaScript (e.g `window.localStorage`).

Heavily inspired from [multipleWindow3dScene](https://github.com/bgstaal/multipleWindow3dScene) by [bgstaal](https://github.com/bgstaal).
